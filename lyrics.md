[verse 1]
```
they call him techno boy, he`s sitting staring into space
instructing machines, man in the suit`s never seen his face

```

[chorus]
```
where are you now, Techno Boy?
what have you seen?
what do you do?
and what does it mean?
```

[verse 2]
```
lost and lonely in Texas
#TODO: Finish Verse 2
```
[chorus]
```
where are you now, Techno Boy?
what have you seen?
what do you do?
and what does it mean?

How can you say, Techno Boy,
that the work here is done?
I will not rest, Techno Boy,
Until two become... one.
```

[bridge]
```
space
space
staring into space
reading urgent emails that will put you in your place

space
space
will it ever end
rising up is technoboy with hacking he will win

space!
space!
he's our guiding light!
shining like a beacon deep into the Texas niiiiiiiight!
```

```
you are my guidance
you are my instrument
you are my lighthouse
in the niiiiiiiiiiiight!
```

[epic guitar solo]
