[verse 1]
```
#TODO: Write Verse 1
```

[chorus]
```
where are you now, Techno Boy?
what have you seen?
what do you do?
and what does it mean?
```

[verse 2]
```
lost and lonely in Texas
#TODO: Finish Verse 2
```
[chorus]
```
where are you now, Techno Boy?
what have you seen?
what do you do?
and what does it mean?

How can you say, Techno Boy,
that the work here is done?
I will not rest, Techno Boy,
Until two become... one.
```

[bridge]
```
you are my guidance
you are my instrument
you are my lighthouse
in the niiiiiiiiiiiight!
```

[epic guitar solo]
